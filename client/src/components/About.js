                <p>DotAI is a project I made to simplify hero selection during crucial drafting phases. The built-in Dota 2 hero categorization often doesn't do the job effectively. DotAI acts as a smart tool for sorting heroes based on what's good for your team, and what's bad for the enemy, making hero selection smarter and smoother.

                I want to note that the categorizations you see here are entirely my own work, that these do not come from a professional background. If you have suggestions on improving the website, please feel free to explore the project on GitHub. Your input and ideas are always welcome!
